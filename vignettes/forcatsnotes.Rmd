## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Didn't realize I was supposed to be writing on this rmd file for the answers.  I was following along.

Edit: went back to write down YTs

search()
library(tidyverse)
install.packages('usethis')
git_vaccinate() (adding things to .ignore file)
newe tab

install and restart on build tab in forcat gives:
* installing to library ‘/home/rstudio-user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5’
ERROR: dependency ‘ellipsis’ is not available for package ‘forcats’
* removing ‘/home/rstudio-user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/forcats’

Exited with status 1.

Needed to instal package ellipsis.  After installing it reads:
* installing to library ‘/home/rstudio-user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5’
* installing *source* package ‘forcats’ ...
** R
** data

** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
** help

** installing vignettes
** testing if installed package can be loaded
* DONE (forcats)


changed function and got an error when saved and tried to re install and restart.

Undid changes and saved and repeated the install and restart.  This fixed the error.

!!!!!!!!!!!Assignment 4/18 - Write me a few (10?) sentences in your Rmd file from Tuesday about making a package.

Rule of 3 we talked about was interesting and follows one of my attitudes towards life, if it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it right then.  If you need/use a function more than 3 times, create a package.  There is a lot of restarting/reloading R to ensure everything is in order.  Editing the descrpition seems to be something important that I've overlooked in the past considering how many packages there are.  We went through a lot of the nuisances and was more than I would have expected.  Licensing and creating readme type docs.
